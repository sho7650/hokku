## Resource Allocation Strategy

### Team Composition

**Minimum Team** (1 Developer):
- **Sequential Execution**: 15 days
- **Optimized Execution**: 10 days (limited parallel capability)
- **Risk**: High (single point of failure)

**Optimal Team** (2 Developers):
- **Parallel Execution**: 8.5 days
- **Developer A** (Senior): Critical path tasks (1.2, 2.1, 3.1, 5.2)
- **Developer B** (Mid-level): Parallel tasks (1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 2.2, 3.2, 4.1, 5.3, 5.4)
- **Shared**: Quality gates, reviews, debugging

**Extended Team** (3+ Developers):
- **Marginal Benefit**: ~7.5 days (diminishing returns)
- **Additional Roles**: QA specialist, DevOps engineer
- **Risk**: Communication overhead, integration complexity

### Skill Requirements

**Essential Skills**:
- Go programming (1.21+)
- HTTP/REST API development
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Git version control
- Unix/Linux command line

**Preferred Skills**:
- Security best practices
- Docker containerization
- YAML configuration
- Performance testing
- CI/CD pipelines

**Knowledge Transfer Areas**:
- Domain-specific requirements (webhook handling)
- Security patterns (path traversal prevention)
- Go project structure conventions
- Quality gate definitions

### Resource Optimization

**Peak Resource Demand**:
- **Days 1-2** (Phase 1): Light load, foundation work
- **Days 3-5** (Phase 2): Heaviest development load
- **Days 6-8** (Phase 3): Moderate load, HTTP layer
- **Days 9-11** (Phase 4): Light load, configuration
- **Days 12-15** (Phase 5): Moderate load, integration

**Load Balancing Strategy**:
```
Phase 2 (Peak): Dev A (File Writer) + Dev B (Validator) = 100% utilization
Phase 4 (Light): Dev A (Auth) + Dev B (Config) = 75% utilization  
Phase 5 (Mixed): Dev A (Integration) + Dev B (Docker/Config) = 85% utilization
```

## Contingency Planning

### Scenario Planning

#### Scenario 1: Major Technical Blocker
**Trigger**: Critical bug in core service, architecture flaw discovered
**Timeline Impact**: +2-3 days
**Response Plan**:
1. **Immediate** (0-2 hours): Problem assessment, stakeholder notification
2. **Short-term** (2-8 hours): Alternative solution research, expert consultation
3. **Resolution** (1-2 days): Implementation of alternative or major refactor
4. **Recovery** (0.5-1 day): Testing and integration of solution

**Prevention**: Comprehensive architecture review, early prototyping

#### Scenario 2: Resource Unavailability
**Trigger**: Developer illness, competing priorities
**Timeline Impact**: +1-4 days depending on timing and duration
**Response Plan**:
1. **Assessment**: Identify critical vs. non-critical tasks affected
2. **Reallocation**: Shift remaining developer to critical path
3. **Scope adjustment**: Defer non-critical features to Phase 6
4. **External help**: Engage contractor if extended absence

**Prevention**: Cross-training, knowledge documentation, contractor pipeline

#### Scenario 3: Quality Gate Failure
**Trigger**: Major quality issues discovered, test coverage insufficient
**Timeline Impact**: +0.5-2 days per failed gate
**Response Plan**:
1. **Root cause analysis**: Identify systemic vs. isolated issues
2. **Targeted fixes**: Address specific failures first
3. **Process improvement**: Update procedures to prevent recurrence
4. **Re-verification**: Complete quality gate requirements

**Prevention**: Continuous quality monitoring, incremental reviews

#### Scenario 4: Scope Expansion
**Trigger**: Stakeholder requests additional features
**Timeline Impact**: Variable (0 days if rejected, +1-5 days if accepted)
**Response Plan**:
1. **Impact assessment**: Analyze scope change implications
2. **Negotiation**: Present timeline/quality trade-offs
3. **Formal approval**: Document scope change and new timeline
4. **Implementation**: Adjust plan and communicate to team

**Prevention**: Clear requirements documentation, change control process

### Recovery Strategies

**Fast Recovery** (same day):
- Use available time buffers
- Parallel developer assistance
- Simplified implementation approach

**Standard Recovery** (1-2 days):
